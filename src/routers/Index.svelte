            <p class="my-class"> Since ancient times, Mars has attracted many people, in the last century, Earth
                scientists managed to touch Mars, and now this whole planet inhabited by robots (but this is not
                accurate ðŸ‘½)<br>

                Mars rovers, the most active of the "Earthlings" that work on the red planet. These multi-wheeled
                explorers weather dust storms, collect soil samples, take selfies and fire lasers. <br>

                Our virtual museum contains up-to-date information about each wheeled explorer of Mars, you can also
                feel involved in space and encode the text using a Martian parachute!<br> Sounds exciting and
                incomprehensible? Then rather explore our museum ðŸš€</p>
